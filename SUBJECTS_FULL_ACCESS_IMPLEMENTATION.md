# Subjects Full Access for Admin & Supervisor ✅

## Summary
Both **Admin** and **Supervisor** roles can now view all subjects and perform full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on subjects, regardless of which class they belong to or if they have no class assigned.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed API Client Integration

**Problem:** Several pages were using `fetch` directly or incorrectly accessing `response.data` when the API client already returns data directly.

**Solution:** Updated all API calls to use the `apiClient` properly:

#### Files Fixed:
- `frontend/app/admin/subjects/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/admin/teachers/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/supervisor/subjects/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// ❌ Before
const response = await apiClient.get('/subjects');
setSubjects(response.data || []);

// ✅ After
const data = await apiClient.get('/subjects');
setSubjects(data || []);
```

---

### 2. Handle Subjects Without Classes

**Problem:** Subjects without a class assigned would cause errors when trying to display `subject.class.name`.

**Solution:** Added conditional rendering for optional fields:

#### Updated Display Logic:
```typescript
// Show code only if it exists
{subject.code && (
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <svg>...</svg>
    <span className="font-medium">{subject.code}</span>
  </div>
)}

// Show class or "No class assigned" message
{subject.class ? (
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <svg>...</svg>
    <span>{subject.class.name} - {subject.class.grade}</span>
  </div>
) : (
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <svg>...</svg>
    <span className="text-amber-600 italic">No class assigned</span>
  </div>
)}
```

---

### 3. Fixed Search Filtering

**Problem:** Search filter would crash when trying to search subjects without code or class.

**Solution:** Added null checks in filter logic:

```typescript
// ❌ Before
const filteredSubjects = subjects.filter(subject =>
  subject.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
  subject.code.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
  subject.class.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
);

// ✅ After
const filteredSubjects = subjects.filter(subject =>
  subject.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
  (subject.code && subject.code.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())) ||
  (subject.class && subject.class.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()))
);
```

### 4. Created Supervisor Subjects Page

**New File:** `frontend/app/supervisor/subjects/page.tsx`

- Identical functionality to admin subjects page
- Updated navigation to link back to `/supervisor` dashboard
- Full CRUD operations available

- Icon: Book/Library icon
- Color: Teal/Green gradient
- Links to: `/admin/subjects`
