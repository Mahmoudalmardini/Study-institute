## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Updated Users Service (`backend/src/modules/users/users.service.ts`)

**Modified `findAll()` method to include teacher subjects:**

```typescript
async findAll(role?: string) {
  const users = await this.prisma.user.findMany({
    where: role ? { role: role as any } : {},
    select: {
      id: true,
      email: true,
      firstName: true,
      lastName: true,
      role: true,
      phone: true,
      isActive: true,
      createdAt: true,
      updatedAt: true,
      teacher: {                    // ✅ ADDED
        select: {
          id: true,
          subjects: {               // ✅ ADDED
            include: {
              subject: {
                include: {
                  class: {          // ✅ ADDED - Shows class info
                    select: {
                      id: true,
                      name: true,
                      grade: true,
                    },
                  },
                },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
      student: {                    // ✅ ADDED for completeness
        select: {
          id: true,
          classId: true,
          class: {
            select: {
              id: true,
              name: true,
              grade: true,
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
    orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
  });

- Single API call fetches teachers with all their subjects

  subjectId  String
  assignedBy String
  assignedAt DateTime @default(now())

  teacher Teacher @relation(fields: [teacherId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  subject Subject @relation(fields: [subjectId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@id([teacherId, subjectId])
  @@map("teacher_subjects")
}
```

**Fields:**
