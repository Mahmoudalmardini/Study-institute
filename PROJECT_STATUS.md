## üìù Notes

### Design Decisions Made
- Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns
- JWT with refresh tokens for security
- Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- Next.js App Router for modern React patterns
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- Role-based access control at API level

### Technical Debt
- File upload system needs actual implementation (currently just URLs)
- Redis caching not yet implemented
- No comprehensive test coverage
- Frontend pagination not implemented
- No email system integrated
- WebSocket for real-time features not added

### Security Considerations Implemented
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token expiration
- Refresh token rotation
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Role-based access control
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting

### Performance Optimizations Needed
- Implement Redis caching layer
- Add more database indexes
- Optimize Prisma queries
- Implement pagination everywhere
- Add request debouncing on frontend
- Lazy load heavy components

## ü§ù Contributing

When continuing this project:
1. Follow the established architecture patterns
2. Add tests for new features
3. Update documentation
4. Follow TypeScript best practices
5. Ensure mobile responsiveness
6. Consider security implications
