## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface StudentHomeworkSubmission {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  files: Array<{
    name: string;
    url: string;
    size: number;
  }>;
  submittedAt: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'graded' | 'returned';
  grade?: number;
  feedback?: string;
  student: {
    id: string;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
  };
}
```

### API Endpoints (Ready for Backend)
```typescript
// GET /api/homework/submissions - Get all submissions (teacher)
// PATCH /api/homework/submissions/:id/grade - Submit grade and feedback
```

### Grading Logic
```typescript
const handleSubmitGrade = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  // Validate grade (0-100)
  const gradeValue = parseInt(gradeForm.grade);
  if (isNaN(gradeValue) || gradeValue < 0 || gradeValue > 100) {
    setError(t.teacher.gradeValue);
    return;
  }
  
  // Submit to backend
  // PATCH /api/homework/submissions/${submissionId}/grade
  // Body: { grade: number, feedback: string }
};
```

### Search & Filter Logic
```typescript
const filteredSubmissions = submissions.filter((submission) => {
  const studentName = `${submission.student.firstName} ${submission.student.lastName}`.toLowerCase();
  const matchesSearch = studentName.includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) || 
                       submission.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase());
  const matchesStatus = statusFilter ? submission.status === statusFilter : true;
  return matchesSearch && matchesStatus;
});
```

Response: {
  data: [
    {
      id: string,
      title: string,
      description: string,
      files: [{ name, url, size }],
      submittedAt: string,

}

Response: {

}
```

### Database Schema Suggestions
```sql
-- homework_submissions table
CREATE TABLE homework_submissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
  grade INTEGER CHECK (grade >= 0 AND grade <= 100),
  feedback TEXT,
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  graded_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- homework_files table
CREATE TABLE homework_files (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  submission_id UUID REFERENCES homework_submissions(id),
  file_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  file_path VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
  file_size BIGINT NOT NULL,
  file_type VARCHAR(100),
  uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
