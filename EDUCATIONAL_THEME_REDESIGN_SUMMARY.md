## Technical Implementation

### Animation Strategy
1. **Entrance Animations**: All dashboard cards use `animate-slide-up` with staggered delays
2. **Hover Effects**: Cards use `hover-lift` class for elevation change
3. **Icon Animations**: Icons scale on card hover (`group-hover:scale-110`)
4. **Smooth Transitions**: All interactive elements have transition-all duration classes
5. **Performance**: Animations use `transform` and `opacity` for 60fps performance

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Responsive grid layouts (1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet, 3 columns desktop for admin)
- Responsive typography (text-lg sm:text-xl)
- Responsive padding and spacing
- Touch-friendly click targets
- Settings text hidden on small screens
- Truncated text where needed

### RTL Support
- `rtl:rotate-180` for directional icons
- `rtl:right-auto rtl:left-0` for dropdown positioning
- `rtl:gap-reverse` for reversed gaps
- `ms-2` instead of `ml-2` for logical properties
- `text-start` instead of `text-left`

### Accessibility
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support in global styles
- Proper ARIA labels on buttons
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus states on all interactive elements
- Semantic HTML structure
- Alt text considerations for icons
