# Railway configuration for monorepo
# This file helps Railway understand the project structure
# 
# IMPORTANT: Each service MUST have its Root Directory set in Railway dashboard:
# - Backend service: Root Directory = "backend", Builder = "Dockerfile"
# - Frontend service: Root Directory = "frontend", Builder = "Dockerfile"
#
# This root-level file is for reference only.
# Railway will use Dockerfile when Root Directory is set correctly.
