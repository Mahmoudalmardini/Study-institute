# Teacher Subject Assignment with Class Filter ✅

## Summary
Enhanced the teacher subject assignment feature to include **class filtering**. Admins and supervisors can now filter available subjects by class when assigning them to teachers, making it easier to organize subject assignments by class.

---

## New Features

### ✅ Class Filter in Subject Assignment Modal

**What's New:**
- **Class dropdown** in the "Available Subjects" section
- **Filter subjects by class** to see only subjects for specific classes
- **Visual class indicators** with icons showing which class each subject belongs to
- **Better organization** - Group subjects by class for easier assignment
- **Enhanced UI** - More visual feedback with icons and colors

---

## How It Works

### 1. Opening the Modal
When you click **"Manage Subjects"** for a teacher, the modal shows:
- **Currently Assigned Subjects** (top section)
- **Available Subjects** (bottom section with class filter)

### 2. Using the Class Filter
At the top of "Available Subjects" section:
```
Available Subjects          [All Classes ▼]
```

**Dropdown Options:**
- All Classes (shows all subjects)
- Grade 10A - Grade 10
- Grade 11B - Grade 11
- etc.

### 3. Filtered View
When you select a class:
- Only subjects from that class are shown
- Each subject displays with a class icon
- Empty state if no subjects available for that class

---

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

**Added:**
```typescript
const [classes, setClasses] = useState<Class[]>([]);
const [selectedClassFilter, setSelectedClassFilter] = useState<string>('');
```

### Data Fetching

**Added:**
```typescript
const fetchClasses = async () => {
  try {
    const data = await apiClient.get('/classes');
    setClasses(data || []);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error fetching classes:', err);
  }
};
```

### Filtering Logic

**Enhanced:**
```typescript
subjects.filter(
  (subject) =>
    // Not already assigned
    !selectedTeacher.teacher?.subjects?.some((ts) => ts.subject.id === subject.id) &&
    // Matches class filter (or showing all)
    (!selectedClassFilter || subject.class?.id === selectedClassFilter)
)
```

---

## UI Components Added

### 1. Class Filter Dropdown
```jsx
<select
  value={selectedClassFilter}
  onChange={(e) => setSelectedClassFilter(e.target.value)}
  className="px-3 py-1.5 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg text-sm focus:ring-2 focus:ring-purple-500 focus:border-transparent"
>
  <option value="">All Classes</option>
  {classes.map((cls) => (
    <option key={cls.id} value={cls.id}>
      {cls.name}{cls.grade ? ` - ${cls.grade}` : ''}
    </option>
  ))}
</select>
```

### 2. Enhanced Subject Cards
Each subject card now includes:
- Subject name (bold)
- Code (if available)
- Class indicator with icon:
  - Cyan school icon for subjects with classes
  - Amber warning icon for subjects without classes
- Hover effect (border color change)

### 3. Improved Empty States
Different messages based on context:
