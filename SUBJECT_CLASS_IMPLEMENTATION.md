# Subject & Class Features Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the subject and class management system, where students submit homework directly to subjects (المواد) they're enrolled in.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema Changes
**File**: `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`

- ✅ Added `TeacherSubject` junction table (many-to-many: teachers ↔ subjects)
- ✅ Added `StudentSubject` junction table (many-to-many: students ↔ subjects)
- ✅ Updated `Homework` model: added optional `subjectId`, made `teacherId` and `dueDate` optional
- ✅ Updated `Submission` model: added `title`, `description`, and optional `subjectId` for direct subject submissions
- ✅ Updated `Subject` model: added relations to teachers, students, and homework
- ✅ Migration created and applied: `20251020231024_add_subject_class_features`

### 2. Backend Modules

#### Classes Module (`backend/src/modules/classes/`)
- ✅ CRUD operations for classes (admin/supervisor only)
- ✅ Endpoints:
  - `POST /classes` - Create class
  - `GET /classes` - List all classes
  - `GET /classes/:id` - Get class details
  - `PATCH /classes/:id` - Update class
  - `DELETE /classes/:id` - Delete class (with validation)

#### Subjects Module (`backend/src/modules/subjects/`)
- ✅ CRUD for subjects linked to classes
- ✅ Teacher assignment/unassignment
- ✅ Endpoints:
  - `POST /subjects` - Create subject
  - `GET /subjects?classId=X` - List subjects (filterable by class)
  - `GET /subjects/:id` - Get subject details
  - `PATCH /subjects/:id` - Update subject
  - `DELETE /subjects/:id` - Delete subject (with validation)
  - `POST /subjects/:id/assign-teacher` - Assign teacher to subject
  - `DELETE /subjects/:id/unassign-teacher/:teacherId` - Unassign teacher
  - `GET /subjects/:id/teachers` - Get teachers by subject

#### Updated Students Module
- ✅ Added `subjectIds` field to `CreateStudentDto`
- ✅ New methods:
  - `enrollSubjects(studentId, subjectIds, enrolledBy)` - Enroll student in subjects
  - `getStudentSubjects(studentId)` - Get enrolled subjects
- ✅ New endpoints:
  - `POST /students/:id/enroll-subjects` - Enroll student in subjects
  - `GET /students/:id/subjects` - Get student's enrolled subjects

#### Teachers Module (`backend/src/modules/teachers/`)
- ✅ Created new module with:
  - `GET /teachers` - List all teachers
  - `GET /teachers/me` - Get teacher profile (for logged-in teacher)
  - `GET /teachers/:id` - Get teacher details
  - `GET /teachers/:id/subjects` - Get subjects taught by teacher

#### Updated Homework Module
- ✅ New methods for subject-based submissions:
  - `submitToSubject(studentUserId, dto, files)` - Submit homework directly to subject (no assignment required)
  - `getSubmissionsBySubject(subjectId, teacherUserId)` - Get submissions by subject
  - `getStudentSubjects(studentUserId)` - Get student's subjects for homework submission
- ✅ New endpoints:
  - `POST /homework/submit-to-subject` - Submit homework to subject
  - `GET /homework/submissions/by-subject/:subjectId` - Get submissions by subject
  - `GET /homework/my-subjects` - Get student's enrolled subjects
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing assignment-based homework

### 3. Frontend Implementation

#### Admin Classes Management (`frontend/app/admin/classes/page.tsx`)
- ✅ List all classes with student/subject counts
- ✅ Create new class with form
- ✅ Edit existing class
- ✅ Delete class (with validation)
- ✅ Assign teacher to class (optional)
- ✅ Fully responsive UI

#### Admin Subjects Management (`frontend/app/admin/subjects/page.tsx`)
- ✅ List subjects with filtering by class
- ✅ Create new subject linked to a class
- ✅ Edit subject details
- ✅ Delete subject (with validation)
- ✅ Manage teacher assignments per subject:
  - View assigned teachers
  - Assign new teachers
  - Unassign teachers
- ✅ Show counts for students and teachers per subject
- ✅ Fully responsive UI

#### Translations
- ✅ Added English translations for classes and subjects
- ✅ Added Arabic translations (المواد/الصفوف)
- ✅ Integrated with i18n system

## 📋 Additional Backend Features

### Validation & Security
- ✅ Role-based access control (ADMIN, SUPERVISOR, TEACHER, STUDENT)
- ✅ Input validation with DTOs
- ✅ Cascade deletion protection (cannot delete class/subject with enrolled students)
- ✅ Unique constraint validation (subject codes, teacher/subject assignments)
- ✅ Enrollment verification (students can only submit to subjects they're enrolled in)

### Data Relationships
- ✅ Class ← Subject (one-to-many: class-specific subjects)
- ✅ Teacher ↔ Subject (many-to-many: teachers can teach multiple subjects, subjects can have multiple teachers)
- ✅ Student ↔ Subject (many-to-many: manually managed by admin/supervisor)
- ✅ Subject ← Submission (one-to-many: direct submission to subject)
- ✅ Subject ← Homework (one-to-many: homework assignments linked to subject)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Admin/Supervisor Workflow:
1. Create classes: `/admin/classes`
2. Create subjects for each class: `/admin/subjects`
3. Assign teachers to subjects (multiple teachers per subject allowed)
4. Create student accounts and enroll them in subjects

### Teacher Workflow:
- View subjects they teach: `GET /teachers/me` → check `subjects`
- View submissions by subject: `GET /homework/submissions/by-subject/:subjectId`

### Student Workflow:
- View enrolled subjects: `GET /homework/my-subjects`
- Submit homework to a subject: `POST /homework/submit-to-subject`
  - Requires: subjectId, title, description, files (optional)
  - Validates student enrollment before accepting submission

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Existing homework assignment flow still works
- ✅ Existing submissions are preserved
- ✅ Teachers can still create homework assignments (optional workflow)
- ✅ New subject-based submission flow runs in parallel

## 📦 Installation & Running

### Backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run build
npm run start:dev
```

### Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Access:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

## 🎯 User Flow Example

### Complete Subject-Based Homework Flow:
1. **Admin creates structure:**
   - Create "First Grade" class (2024-2025)
   - Create "Math" subject for "First Grade" (code: MATH-1)
   - Assign Mr. Ahmed to teach "Math"
   - Create student account for Ali
   - Enroll Ali in "Math" subject

2. **Student submits homework:**
   - Ali logs in → views enrolled subjects
   - Selects "Math" subject
   - Submits homework with title, description, and files
   - System validates Ali is enrolled in Math

3. **Teacher reviews:**
   - Mr. Ahmed logs in → views Math subject
   - Sees all submissions for Math
   - Reviews and grades Ali's submission

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Subjects are class-specific**: Each class has its own set of subjects (e.g., "Math for Grade 1" is separate from "Math for Grade 2")

2. **Flexible teacher assignment**: Multiple teachers can teach the same subject (team teaching supported)

3. **Manual student enrollment**: Students must be manually enrolled in subjects by admin/supervisor (not automatic from class assignment)

4. **Direct submission model**: Students submit homework directly to subjects without requiring a pre-created homework assignment from teachers

## 🔧 API Testing Examples

### Create a class:
```bash
POST /classes
{
  "name": "First Grade",
  "grade": "1",
  "academicYear": "2024-2025"
}
```

### Create a subject:
```bash
POST /subjects
{
  "name": "Mathematics",
  "code": "MATH-1",
  "description": "Basic mathematics",
  "classId": "<class-id>"
}
```

### Assign teacher to subject:
```bash
POST /subjects/<subject-id>/assign-teacher
{
  "teacherId": "<teacher-id>"
}
```

### Enroll student in subjects:
```bash
POST /students/<student-id>/enroll-subjects
{
  "subjectIds": ["<subject-id-1>", "<subject-id-2>"]
}
```

### Submit homework to subject:
```bash
POST /homework/submit-to-subject
FormData: {
  subjectId: "<subject-id>",
  title: "Math Homework Week 5",
  description: "Completed exercises 1-10",
  files: [file1, file2]
}
```

## 📝 Database Changes Summary

### New Tables:
- `teacher_subjects` - Teacher-Subject assignments
- `student_subjects` - Student-Subject enrollments

### Modified Tables:
- `homework` - Added `subjectId` (optional), made `teacherId` and `dueDate` optional
- `submissions` - Added `title`, `description`, `subjectId` (optional), made `homeworkId` optional
- `subjects` - Added relations
- `students` - Added subjects relation
- `teachers` - Added subjects relation

All changes are non-breaking and maintain backward compatibility with existing data.

## ✨ Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)
